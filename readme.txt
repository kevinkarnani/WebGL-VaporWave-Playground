CS 432 Final Project README
Stephen Hansen, Kevin Karnani

Please see CS_432_Final_Project_Documentation.pdf for the project documentation.

All of the code needed to run the project is included in the "code" directory.
Simply spin up Python's simple HTTP web server in that directory, and then
navigate to http://localhost:8000/index.html in either Chrome or Firefox.
You may need to be patient and wait for the webpage to load. Some of the models
used have a large number of vertices. Once the canvas loads, you should be able
to interact with it and play around in our scene without any significant slowdown.

The video demonstration has been posted on the Blackboard Learn forum.

Additional Advanced Features

We have implemented reflection (environment mapping), shadows, and particle systems.
This should cover the three major advanced features discussed in class. In addition,
we also implemented an OBJ file loader and some filter effects for one of our shaders,
but these might not fall under the "advanced features" label.

Enjoy!
